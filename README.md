The RoboRoach is the world's first commercially available cyborg! Created by Backyard Brains.  This repository contains the software, hardware, and firmware for the complete cyborg system. The hardware currently relies on the CC2540 and Blue Tooth Low Energy, so Apple MFI contracts to not apply.  To program, you will need a CC Debugger by TI.  The PCB is currently configured to use a TAG Connect port. 

Overview
--------
Have you ever wanted to walk down the hall of your school or department with your own remote controlled cockroach? We are now excited to announce the world's first commercially available cyborg! With our RoboRoach you can briefly wirelessly control the left/right movement of a cockroach by microstimulation of the antenna nerves. The RoboRoach is a great way to learn about neurotechnology, learning, and electronics!
